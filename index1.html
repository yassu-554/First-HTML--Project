<p><strong>  SALAAR IS THE EVER GREEN AMAZING MOVIE</strong> In the vibrant city of Khansaar during the year 1985, two inseparable friends, Deva and Vardharaja “Vardha” Mannar, were united by fate in a tumultuous atmosphere. The metropolis was under a monarchical regime, ruled by Raja Mannar, Vardha’s father. During this pivotal year, the Shouryaanga tribe faced a horrific fate at the hands of Raja Mannar, an event that would irrevocably alter the lives of Deva and his mother. After a violent mob targeted their home, it was none other than Vardha who stepped in to protect them, granting them a lifeline in exchange for their lives. As Deva left Khansaar, he pledged to return whenever Vardha called, unaware that destiny had further plans for them.</p>
